						<h2>Playoff Clinching and Elimination in the NBA</h2>

As the end of the season approaches, fans like to engage in speculation about which teams will advance to the
playoffs (the top eight in each conference) and whether their favorite team is still in contention. Sports media
publish articles declaring that a particular team has been <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/sports/knicks-eliminated-playoffs.html">eliminated from contention</a> or
that the <a
href="http://www.wtmj.com/sports/basketball/milwaukee-bucks/bucks-first-team-in-nba-to-clinch-playoff-spot/1046294500">first
place team has clinched a playoff berth</a>.  On this page we start with an <a href="#intro">introductory
example</a> of how these determinations can often be made by looking at the standings and making a few simple
calculations. We also use this example to show how the RIOT numbers improve on the simple calculations by taking the
remaining schedule of games and the NBA's two-team tiebreakers into account.  Next, we given an example of how the
RIOT standings can actually tell you when a team has locked up a playoff spot or fallen out of contention <a
href="#GoldenState">days before it is reported anywhere else!</a> Determining when a team has clinched a playoff
berth can be quite complex. In fact, we show an example on this page where
<a href="#Boston">even the NBA got it wrong.</a> At the <a href="#MIP">end of the page</a> we briefly discuss the
role of advanced analytics in calculating the RIOT numbers and give suggestions for further reading.

<p>
The Games Left (GL) columns shows that the New York Knicks have 17 games left to play in the season. The Knicks
have 13 wins at this point, so they can finish the season with at most 30.
Since there's no way that the Knicks can catch up to the first-place Milwaukee Bucks who already have 48 wins, the
standings show that New York is mathematically eliminated from first place. This is indicated by the word "Elim" in
the "1st" column under the "Avoid Elim" heading. Since there are six other teams that are also eliminated from
first place, the Bucks are guaranteed to be one of the top eight teams in the final standings. The word "In" in the
"Postseason" column under the "Clinch" column indicates that Milwaukee has clinched a playoff spot.

<h3>Taking the Schedule into Account</h3>

It's not obvious from the standings why the Knicks are eliminated from the playoffs. If the they win all of their
remaining games while the current 8th and 9th place Miami Heat and Orlando Magic lose all of theirs, then New York
could finish the season with 30 wins in a three-way tie with Miami and Orlando. However, if we look at the <a
href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHO/2019_games.html">Charlotte Hornet's schedule<a/>, we see that they play Miami on 3/17 and
Orlando on 4/10. Our hypothetical three-way tie would have the Hornets (currently 29 and 35) wining both of these
games and moving ahead of the three 30-win teams in the final standings. So no matter how many more games the Knicks
win, they can't make the playoffs. This is indicated by the word "Elim" in the "postseason" column under the "Avoid
Elim" heading.

<h3>Taking Tiebreakers into Account</h3>

<h4>Milwaukee's First Place Clinch Number</h4>

The standings table above indicates that Milwaukee can clinch first place in the conference by winning 15 more
games.  Again, this is not obvious from the standings. Winning 15 more games would bring the Bucks win total to 48
+ 15 = 63, which is also the maximum number of wins that the Toronto Raptors can achieve (46 + 17). So it's possible
that the Bucks and Raptors could finish in a first-place tie with 63 wins each. However, Milwaukee would be awarded
first place in this scenario since they have already won the season series with Toronto three games to one.

<h4>Toronto's First Place Elimination Number</h4>

Due to the losing the tiebreaker, Toronto will have to get to at least 49 wins to finish in first place in the
conference. Notice that that their First Place Elimination number is 3. That is, they have a 3 in the "1st" column
under the "Avoid Elim" heading. This indicates that there is a scenario in which the Raptors come in first place in
the conference with a 49 and 33 record. Likewise, there's a scenario where the Bucks win the conference despite
losing all of their remaining games.


<h4>Indiana's First Place Elimination Number</h4>

Indiana's First Place Elimination Number in the standings table is 6, indicating that there's a scenario in which
they come in first place in the conference with a 48 and 32. Clearly, this would involve a tie with the Bucks. At
this point in season the Bucks lead the series 2 games to 1. In the scenario indicated in the standings table,
the Pacers win their fourth, and final, game with the Bucks, and win enough other games against the right teams to
win the tiebreaker.

<a name="GoldenState"><h2>A Missed Call: Golden State Clinched and Didn't Realize It</h2></a>

On March 12, 2018 the <a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/playoffs-2018-clinched">NBA announced that the
Golden State Warriors had clinched their sixth straight playoff berth</a>.  This was true, but it turns out that the
Warriors and their fans could have celebrated the clinch three days earlier.  This surprising discovery is reported
in the whitepaper "National Basketball Association Playoff Elimination with Tiebreaking" by Husted, Olinick, and
Newman who explain the situation as follows.
<p>
The table below shows the Western Conference standings at the time in question, immediately after all games had been
played on March 9, 2018. The Maximum Possible Wins column shows that the five teams in Group C were going to finish
the season behind Golden State, which had already won 51 games.  It appears that the Warriors had not yet clinched a
playoff spot because there were nine teams that could have potentially finished with better records: Houston and the
eight teams in Group B.  However, it turns out that regardless of the way in which the rest of the games in the
season concluded, Golden State was guaranteed to make the playoffs.

<p>
A straightforward calculation shows at most seven of the teams in Group B could have finished the season with 51 or
more wins, which means that Golden State was already guaranteed to finish the season ahead of at least six teams in
the conference.  Observe that the sum of the Maximum Possible Wins for this group was 428. This counts the games in
the right-most column of the standings table twice. Therefore, the maximum collective win total for the this group
was 428 - 25 = 403, and the maximum average number of wins for these teams was 403 &#247; 8 = 50.38. Keep in mind
that at least one of the teams would have to be at or below average in wins. Rounding 50.38 down to 50, this means
at least one of these eight teams would necessarily finish the season with 50 or fewer wins (i.e., behind Golden
State in the standings).
<p>
Using this observation, we can significantly reduce the number of scenarios under consideration. For example,
suppose Utah is the team with 50 or fewer wins. In this case, the data in the standings table indicate that the
seven other teams in the group would have a maximum collective win total of 403 - (52 - 5) = 356, and a maximum
average of 50.86 wins per team. Therefore, at least one other team in the group besides Utah would have to finish
the season with 50 or fewer wins. This implies that Golden State would be guaranteed to finish in a playoff position
ahead of a least seven teams in the conference: two in the Group B and the five in Group C.
<p>
The table below shows the maximum average number of wins achievable by the remaining teams in Group B in any
scenario in which a particular team from the group finishes behind Golden State in the standings with fewer than 51
wins and misses the playoffs.  As in the Utah case, Golden State makes the playoffs in all the cases for which the
average is less than 51.

</table>
<p>
The table shows that there are only two cases in which Golden State could conceivably not make the playoffs due to
being tied in the standings with seven 51-win teams in the Group B:

<ol>
<li>The LA Clippers finish the season with fewer than 51 wins.
<p>
In this case, Golden State would have more wins than any of the other teams in the Pacific Division and therefore
make the playoffs by winning the tie-breaker.
<li>San Antonio finishes the season with fewer than 51 wins.
<p>
In this case, Golden State could finish in a 51-win tie with division rival the LA Clippers. However, Golden State
would still be declared the winner of the Pacific Division because it had already won the season series against the
Clippers, three games to one.
</ol>

Thus, Golden State had in fact clinched a playoff spot on March 9, 2018 three days before it was announced by the
NBA.

<hr>
<a name="Boston"><h2>A Bad Call: Boston Clinch Called Prematurely</h2></a>

Our model identified a case in which the <a
href="https://www.nba.com/article/2018/03/08/boston-celtics-clinch-playoff-berth">NBA erroneously reported that
Boston had clinched a playoff spot on March 8, 2018</a>. The records of the top nine teams in the Eastern Conference
immediately after all games had been played on this date are given in the table below.  Observe that if Boston (46
current wins) and Detroit (29 current wins) were to have lost and won the rest of their games, respectively, the two
teams would have both finished the season with 46 wins.  This would have put Boston and Detroit in a tie for 8th
place as the 10th place team at the time could have finished the season with at most 45 wins (i.e., Charlotte had
won 28 games and had 17 left play). Boston had already won the season series with Detroit by beating them two of the
three times they played against each other, and, hence, the head-to-head tie breaker (first tie-breaking criterion).
It appeared that Boston had clinched a playoff spot, as announced by the NBA. Unfortunately for Celtics fans,
however, this announcement was premature.
<p>
Specifically, the table below provides a scenario, in terms of the wins and losses for the top nine teams in the
Eastern Conference, in which Boston would not make the playoffs based on the standings and schedule of remaining
games as of the end of the night March 8, 2018. In our scenario Toronto wins the Atlantic Division, Milwaukee wins
the Central Division, and Washington wins the Southeast Division; Philadelphia has enough wins to qualify for the
playoffs and there is a five-way tie for the last four playoff positions between Boston, Cleveland, Detroit,
Indiana, and Miami. Since none of the tied teams are leading a division, the second criterion is used to break the
five-way tie: record (win percentage) against the other four teams in the tie.  Notice that in the scenario table
Indiana has wins against Boston and Miami, and Miami has a win against Cleveland.
Adding these hypothetical wins and losses to the <a href="#">actual outcomes of the games
between these five teams played prior to March March 8, 2018</a>, the
win percentages considering only the games played between the five tied teams in the scenario are
Boston (0.462), Cleveland (0.571), Detroit (0.467), Indiana (0.500), and Miami (0.500). In this case, Boston would
have the worst tied-team win percentage and be eliminated from the playoffs. In actual fact, Boston did clinch a
playoff spot, but not until five days later as determined by our model.

<a name=MIP><h2>Advanced Analytics for Playoff Clinching and Elimination</h2></a>

As the examples on this page show, the key to determining true clinching and elimination numbers is taking into
account the actual matchups that remain in the season and enumerating all possible outcomes. Until the final weeks
of the season, however, the number of possible outcomes can be astronomically large, which makes such an enumeration
impractical even on a very fast computer. By using a powerful and pervasive analytics technique called Mixed Integer
Programming, it is possible to accurately perform the necessary calculations without explicitly enumerating all
possibilities. Consequently, it is possible for RIOT to determine the playoff prospects of a team before it is
reported by the popular media.
